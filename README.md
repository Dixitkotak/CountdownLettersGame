# Countdown Game - C# Implementation

## Overview

This project is a C# implementation of a 1-player version of the Countdown letters game. 
The game allows the user to select letters, and the program determines the longest possible word that can be formed using those letters. 
The program fetches a list of English words from an online dictionary API and scores the longest word found in each round.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Choose consonants or vowels for each round.
- **Word Validation**: Automatically checks if a word can be formed from the selected letters.
- **Scoring**: Scores the longest word found in each round.
- **Round Management**: Supports four rounds of gameplay.
- **Total Score**: Keeps track of the total score across all rounds.
